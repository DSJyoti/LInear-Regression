* This repository focuses on implementing and understanding Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. 

* Features

* Simple & Multiple Linear Regression: Predict continuous outcomes using one or more input features.

* Gradient Descent Optimization: Improve model training efficiency.

* Regularization (Ridge & Lasso): Prevent overfitting by adding penalties to coefficients.

* Model Evaluation: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
